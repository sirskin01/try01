# [Project 3: Power BI HR Attrition Dashboard] 

### Project Goal: Is to analyze the HR Attrition currently taking place in the organization

### I collected the data, stored, transformed, and retrieved it for analysis and reporting purposes. Using query editor, I was able to promote the headers as this was missing from the original dataset.  I also transformed the Age column to integer, changed salary type from monthly to yearly and added the salary column to the dataset. I also added a conditional column called Attrition count.
### In the data model view, I computed the Age bins category to make our analysis much more efficient. I also calculated measures like Attrition rate, Average salary, Max salary, Min salary and Active employees.
### I created reports using Card, column charts, clustered bar chart, donut chart, pie chart, line chart and slicers for comparison and analysis purposes. The reports were shared within user groups using power Bi apps and then published to power Bi services. By pinning the visuals from the reports, I created a dashboard. I implemented static and dynamic Row level security in the data model in power bi desktop and assigned roles to the users.
## Overview of the Dashboard

# [Project 4: Tableau Sample SuperStore Dashboard] 

### Project Goal: Is to analyze the company's sales and profit performances. The dashboard also shows the different kPI’s as well as the current year to date sales of all categories and subcategories. 
### I imported the data from Kaggle, checked for null values. I created the different KPI’s, which include sales kpi, profit kpi and quantity kpi to show the amount of progress made towards the different measurable goals. The YTD vs PYTD of sub-categories shows the phone categories are performing better than the labels.
