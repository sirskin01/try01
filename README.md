# [Project 1: HR Attrition dashboard] 
## Project Goal: Analyze the HR Attrition currently taking place in the organization
•	I collected the data, stored, transformed, and retrieved it for analysis and reporting purposes. Using query editor, I was able to promote the headers as this was missing from the original dataset.  I also transformed the Age column to integer, changed salary type from monthly to yearly and added the salary column to the dataset. I also added a conditional column called Attrition count.
•	In the data model view, I computed the Age bins category to make our analysis much more efficient. I also calculated measures like Attrition rate, Average salary, Max salary, Min salary and Active employees.
•	I created reports using Card, column charts, clustered bar chart, donut chart, pie chart, line chart and slicers for comparison and analysis purposes. The reports were shared within user groups using power Bi apps and then published to power Bi services. By pinning the visuals from the reports, I created a dashboard. I implemented static and dynamic Row level security in the data model in power bi desktop and assigned roles to the users.
